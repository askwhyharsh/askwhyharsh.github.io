# Hi, I'm Harsh! 👋  

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building decentralized applications and distributed systems, i like coding in GO, but also have worked with Js/Ts/Solidity/C. currently learning ZK

## 🚀 What I've Worked On  

### Professional Experience (4y)
- **[Caddy.Finance](https://caddy.finance)** - Architected and developed core smart contract infrastructure for Caddy’s protocol contracts, also contributed to backend services written is NestJS
- **[Qiro.fi](https://qiro.fi)** – Wrote Protocol Smart contracts and also worked on the underwriting protocol, that allowed decentralised underwriting onchain using ritual.net . 
- **[Alive.house](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alivemusic/)** – Contributed to blockchain and backend infrastructure for a gamified music NFT platform, all the auction types and mints onchain.   

### Personal Projects  
  - **[LinkCollect.io](https://linkcollect.io)** A social bookmarking tool. I Built to simplify content curation and sharing
  - **[Near Talk - chat with people around you](https://github.com/askwhyharsh/neartalk)**: Anon talks with people around you, adding more features soon
  - **[Function Layer AVS](https://github.com/askwhyharsh/function_layer_AVS)**: A Offchain but decentralised actively validated service on EigenLayer that helps with decntralised computation of functions in any language (js/go/py) in decentralised manner, and to be able to call these function from within solidity contracts and use the outputs. 
  - **[Blockchain-in-Golang](https://github.com/askwhyharsh/blockchain-with-libp2p)**: built a basic blockchain with PoW consensus in golang, using libp2p lib for peer connection, streams blockchain with connected peers every n seconds. A Simple version build for fun
  - **[Zen Store - Distribute File Storage (build on top of TCP in Go)](https://github.com/askwhyharsh/zen-store)**: Building Distributed P2P file storage (minimal version)
