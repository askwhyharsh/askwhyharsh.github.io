          It's been some time since I have been reading some of Krishnamurti's work and to be really honest, it has done some profound and meaningful impact on my daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first book of K that I read was "The Book of Life" - I had found JK from somewhere on the internet. After that I picked up "Freedom from the Known" and I am still reading that one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this notes series, I want to go through some of the discussions and videos of him, trying to understand and look deeper into how his insights and way of thinking and observing, that might help us bring more clarity and awareness in our daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my first time attempting to write something non-technical, but I am going to give this a shot anyways : )
        </p>

        <p class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 my-6">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Some of the points I touch upon here can easily be taken out of context if read as conclusions or prescriptions. The discussions and inquiries I'm referring to are probably not at the level of behaviour, morality, or belief, but at the psychological level — how the mind observes, reacts, and creates meaning. Without that context, these notes may sound abstract or even misleading.

          "To observe is the most important thing in life" - J. K
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic my-6">
          "You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something" - Richard Feynman
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          So K seems to return to again and again to the concept of <em>observation,</em> but <strong>not as a technique or as a practice to be mastered over time - rather as something immediate, simple, and strangely difficult.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When K says <em>"To observe is the most important thing in life"</em>, it is most likely that he does not mean observation in the ordinary sense of collecting facts or forming opinions. He is not talking about analysis, interpretation, or judgment. In fact, he often points out that the moment analysis enters, observation has already ended.
        </p>

        <p>
          Observation, as K uses the word, is seeing <em>what is</em> — without the interference of the observer. This is where it starts to feel unsettling.
        </p>

        <p>Normally, when I say <em>"I am observing"</em>, there is always a subtle center involved: <strong>I</strong> am watching, <strong>I</strong> am judging, <strong>I</strong> am comparing what I see with what I already know. K questions this entire structure. He asks: <em>Is there observation when the observer is present?</em> Or is the observer itself part of the disturbance?</p>

        <p>Most of our seeing is never direct. We look at life through layers: memory, experience, knowledge, conditioning, fear and desire. So when I look at a person, I am not really seeing <em>them</em>. I am seeing my image of them — formed from past conversations, past hurts, past pleasures. The same applies when I look at myself. I do not see <em>what I am</em>, but what I think I am, or what I want to become.</p>

        <p>
          K often says that <strong>the observer <em>is</em> the observed</strong>. What we call the "observer" is in reality a bundle of memories and reactions, and those memories are exactly what we are trying to observe.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Observation without choice</p>

        <p>
          Another phrase K frequently uses is <em>"choiceless awareness"</em>. This does not mean passivity or indifference. It means awareness without preference — without trying to hold on to pleasant experiences or push away unpleasant ones. In daily life, this is extremely clear if we look closely.
        </p>

        <p>For example: When irritation arises while waiting in traffic, the usual response is to justify it ("This traffic is stupid") or suppress it ("I shouldn't be angry"). Rarely do we simply <em>observe</em> irritation as it arises in the body and mind, without naming it, without escaping it.</p>

        <p>
          K suggests that the very act of <em>pure observation</em> brings a kind of intelligence with it. Not intelligence as knowledge, but intelligence as clarity. When anger is fully observed, without resistance or indulgence, it begins to dissolve, not because we did something to it, but most likely because we no longer feed it.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Modern life and the difficulty of seeing</p>

        <p>
          In modern life, observation is constantly interrupted. Although I am no saint and as guilty of doing this, but take social media as an example. Doom scrolling for most of us is not observation. It is reaction: Like, Dislike, Compare, Envy, Judge. There is no space to see what is happening <em>inside us</em> as we engage with it. K would probably say that we are not living—we are merely responding.
        </p>

        <p>
          K is uncompromising here. He also says that "<strong>without understanding oneself, no system, method, or ideology can bring clarity</strong> and self-understanding does not come through effort, but through observation"
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Seeing without naming</p>

        <p>
          One of K's most striking points is about <em>naming</em>. The moment we name something, we stop seeing it. This is why the Feynman quote fits so perfectly here. Knowing the word "anxiety" does not mean knowing anxiety. Knowing the word "depression" does not mean understanding sorrow. The word becomes a shield, it gives us the illusion of understanding while preventing direct contact.
        </p>

        <p>
          K often invites the listener to watch a tree, a cloud, or a sunset without naming it. Not "oak", not "beautiful", not "sunset"—just seeing. The same quality of attention, he suggests, can be brought to inner states. When fear arises, can it be observed without calling it fear? Without saying: "This is bad", "This will pass", "I shouldn't feel this"?
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of observation is not something one can practice mechanically. The moment it becomes a practice, it becomes another form of becoming, another goal. And that may be the most challenging part of K's teaching: <strong>there is no method</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">On Conclusions</p>

        <p>
          He repeatedly points out that <strong>a conclusion is the end of inquiry</strong>. The moment the mind arrives at a conclusion—<em>"I understand this"</em>, <em>"This is how I am"</em>, <em>"This is the truth"</em>—it stops observing. What takes over is memory. From that point onward, we are no longer looking at life directly, we are looking through the conclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          K does not treat conclusions as neutral or practical tools. He sees them as <strong>psychological anchors</strong> fixed points the mind clings to for certainty and security.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic my-6">
          "A mind that has come to a conclusion is a dead mind."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This is not an exaggeration, in K's language - A "dead" mind is not immoral or stupid, it is simply incapable of discovery. It can repeat, defend, and argue, but it cannot learn.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why conclusions are dangerous</p>

        <p>According to K, conclusions arise from: fear of uncertainty, desire for psychological safety, the urge to know where one stands. I think we conclude because not knowing feels uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>For example: <em>"I am an anxious person."</em> <em>"People cannot be trusted."</em> <em>"I know myself pretty well."</em> These statements feel stabilizing. They give the mind something solid to stand on. But K would say that <strong>the moment we conclude, we stop meeting reality as it is</strong>. <strong>An anxious person yesterday may not be anxious today but the conclusion carries yesterday into today, distorting perception</strong></p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion vs understanding</p>

        <p>Krishnamurti makes a sharp distinction between <em>understanding</em> and <em>concluding</em>. Understanding according to him is alive. It moves. It has no final shape. A conclusion is static. It says, <em>"This is it."</em></p>

        <p>
          K often says that <strong>truth is a living thing</strong>, not something you can pin down and carry around. The moment you say <em>"I have understood"</em>, what you are holding is no longer truth—it is a memory of an insight. That memory may be useful at a practical level, but psychologically it becomes a barrier.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusions and the observer</p>

        <p>This ties directly into K's idea that <em>the observer is the observed</em>. So when we observe through conclusions, we probably are actually observing through the past. This means we are never in contact with the present. K asks a difficult question:</p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic my-6">
          Can you look at something without concluding what it is?
        </blockquote>
